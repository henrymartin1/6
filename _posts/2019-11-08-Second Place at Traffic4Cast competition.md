I very happy to announce, that my team colleagues and I won the second place at the IARAI [Traffic4Cast](https://www.iarai.ac.at/traffic4cast/) NeurIPS competition. You can check out our [code](https://github.com/mie-lab/traffic4cast) and a short [documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13824) of our submission. 
I am going to present the results at [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) 2019.

Special thanks to my team members [Ye Hong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ye_Hong9), [Dominik Bucher](http://dominikbucher.com/), [Christian Rupprecht](https://chrirupp.github.io/) and [Ren√© Buffat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ren%C3%A9-buffat-155398a0/?originalSubdomain=ch) !
