During my doctorate I am involved in various research and industry projects. Here is a short overview of the most important ones. 

## Empirical use and Impact analysis of MaaS
The Empirical use and Impact analysis of MaaS (EIM) Project focused on the question whether and how Mobility as a Service (MaaS) changes travel behavior (e.g., mode choice) and how we can represent mobility data better to create machine learning applications for the prediction and interpretation of individual mobility. The core of the project was a user study designed around the introduction of yumuv, a new MaaS product launched in Zurich, Switzerland, in Q3/2020. 

We collected a multi-source dataset (survey data, GPS tracking data, and context data) of 498 users (71 in treatment group, 427 in control group) over a period of 3-month during the roll-out of the MaaS product yumuv. A mode choice analysis showed that the MaaS bundle mainly increased the usage of e-scooters with a small positive effect on public transport usage. Substitutes are mainly trips with personal bicycles as well as personal e-bikes. The bundle had no influence on the use of personal cars. Furthermore, we present a graph-based representation for individual mobility as well as an application to use it for the identification of dataset independent user groups.

[This](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/546012) poster shows a summary of the project. There is also a longer [slide based report](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/521380) available in German.

## COMMIT – Context-Aware Mobility Mining Tools
The COMMITis a collaboration with the Swiss Data Science Center [SDSC](https://datascience.ch/) I work on scalable methods for large-scale and context aware trajectory analysis and prediction. [More information.](https://datascience.ch/project/context-aware-mobility-mining-tools-commit/)

## Trackintel
Closely aligned with the goal of the COMMIT project my colleagues [Dominik Bucher](http://dominikbucher.com/), Ye Hong, Nina Wiedemann and I have the goal to publish our work on trajectory analysis in an ordered and reusable way. We do this by creating the open source framework trackintel in parallel to our work. It contains many useful methods to analyze GPS trajectories.

## Optimizing the potential impact of personal and autonomous electric mobility on grid stability (SCCER Mobility digitalization)
The high power demand of electric vehicles (EVs) during charging forces us to study Swiss mobility and energy systems as a whole and makes the consideration of the grid impact a requirement. Vehicle-​to-grid (V2G) opens an avenue for the successful integration of EVs in the energy system. This project will offer support for the fulfillment of the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050 from the perspective of energy infrastructure and smart charging. The outcome of this project will provide optimal charging schedules for electric vehicles by investigating the interaction between the grid and electric vehicles.

## SBB Green Class 1 + 2
In 2016 and 2017 the SBB launched [two pilot studies](https://www.sbb.ch/en/travelcards-and-tickets/railpasses/greenclass/about-sbb-green-class/pilot-projects.html) to investigate the impact of comprehensive mobility-as-a-service packages on peoples everyday mobility behavior. We provide the lead scientific support for this new research project SBB Green Class, and use surveys, interviews and spatio-temporal movement data to analyses to examine how such a multi-modal mobility offer influences people’s mobility behavior. Very soon we will publish the final report with more information! 

## SCCER Mobility
My research is also part of the [The Swiss Competence Center for Energy Research – Efficient Technologies and Systems for Mobility (SCCER Mobility)](https://www.sccer-mobility.ch/). Find me at the annual conference!
